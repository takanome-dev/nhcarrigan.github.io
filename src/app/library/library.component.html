      As you walk in to this hall of knowledge, your eyes readjust to the dim
      candle light. The first thing you notice is just how quiet it is. Which
      makes sense, libraries are always quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the entrance is a large desk. A polite but quiet woman sits there. As
      she notices you, she waves you over. When you approach the desk, she
      speaks to you.

    <p>
      The librarian hands you the book you asked for. You slowly open it,
      turning through the pages.
    </p>

      <p *ngFor="let line of openBook.text">{{ line }}</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Closing the book, you hand it back to the librarian, who smiles at you.
