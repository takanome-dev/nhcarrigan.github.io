          <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
          <p>
            In April of 2020, I left my job as a grocery retail manager due to
            circumstances related to the pandemic. After about two weeks of
            lounging around, I found the boredom to be a bit much, and began
            looking for a hobby. I did a quick Google search and came across
            <a
              href="https://freecodecamp.org"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >freeCodeCamp</a
            >. There I began my studies, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
            continued on with learning a bit of React, jQuery, and other front
            end libraries before moving on to NodeJS with express and MongoDB.
            After completing what was, at the time, the entirety of the
            freeCodeCamp curriculum, I sought to further expand my studies. I
            dove in to TypeScript, working on a project with a fellow developer
            I met through the freeCodeCamp community. Then I branched out and
            explored Angular (the new version, not AngularJS 😉). I discovered a
            passion for building Discord Bots (my largest project to date is a
            Discord bot), and have continued to progress my learning since.
          </p>
          <h3>Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Outside of my development circle, I pursue a few hobbies. I am an
            avid gamer, mostly playing RPG games on the PC. When gaming, I
            usually play as my old character Becca Lyria. Becca is also the
            character I use when I play Dungeons and Dragons, another hobby of
            mine. Trading card games are also something I enjoy, with my
            favourite being Magic: The Gathering. Finally, with what little time
            I have left, I enjoy reading a good book.
          </p>
